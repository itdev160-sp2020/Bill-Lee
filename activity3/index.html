        <h2>Specification</h2>
        <p>Powered by an 8th-generation Intel Core i7-8750H with six cores and 12 threads, <br>
            with a base frequency of 2.20GHz and a max turbo frequency of 4.10GHz. <br>
            This is Intel’s flagship mobile CPU, and it easily outclasses the processors<br>
             found in most laptops, and even in many desktop PCs.<br>
            The GX531GX features an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 with Max-Q design, which is Nvidia’s high-end mobile card.<Br>
           It’s one of the most powerful gaming graphics cards ever included in a gaming laptop, <br>
            and the Max-Q design means it’s thinner than standard mobile GPUs.</p>

            <p>I have worked in technology for 30 years, and decided to research<br>
                 and look for a laptop that would satisfy my needs while traveling for a while.</p>

            <p>This laptop is an absolute power-house. It runs very well, it cools even better <br>
                and performs like no other. You will play any game you want at full settings,<br>
                 with zero thermal throttling. Insane!<br>
                 I can not recommend this enough.</p>

            <p>I really like how compact this laptop is. It’s lightweight but sturdy enough for international travel.<br>
                 I wish the battery life was more robust but overall it’s a great value for the money!
